# workyProject

## Abstract:

Due to the covid-19 pandemic, many people either have lost their jobs or are now working from home. Using the US job market as reference, nearly third of the US workforce has done freelance work at some point in their career and based on studies 43% of the working US population will turn to freelance work over the next few years.

In **Worky**, we aim to help the Palestinian market by introducing a freelancing and services searching website. We see that adopting the US experience in Palestine will help the economy and the Palestinians who are searching for an alternate way of income.
